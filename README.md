Welcome to the NHL Stenden Arduino Bot project! This project has 3 robots that will going to work with each other in a race. The goal is to put the cone on the finish line of the race.

## Requirement
 - Arduino NANO microcontroller
 - PCB with an Arduino UNO footprint for additional shields
 - Metal chassis
 - Powerbank (10.000 mAh)
 - 2 On/Off switches, for the logic circuit and the motor circuit
 - A gripper with a servo motor
 - 4 Neopixels (tricolor leds) for signaling (head-, blink- or brake-lights)
 - 3 Pushbuttons (optional)
 - 3 Leds (red, yellow, green optional)
 - Motor driver suitable for two electromotors
 - 2 Electromotors
 - 2 Rotation sensors
 - Ultrasonic distance sensor
 - 8 Analogue line follower sensors
 - Mini breadboard for experimental purposes
 - ESP01 module (AT Wifi Modem optional)
 - Bluetooth HC05 module (optional)
